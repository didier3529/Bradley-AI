# ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE SETUP REQUIRED

## Add Environment Variable

**IMPORTANT**: Add this line to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID=live_default_demo_environment_id
```

## How to do this:

1. Open `.env.local` in your project root (create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Add the line above
3. Save the file
4. Restart your development server with `npm run dev`

## Testing the Fixes

After adding the environment variable:

1. **Visit `/dynamic-demo`** to test the enhanced Dynamic.xyz implementation
2. **Visit `/wallet-demo`** to compare both implementations side-by-side
3. **Test Phantom connection** - it should now connect properly without stalling
4. **Test modal consistency** - the Dynamic modal should appear every time

## What We Fixed:

âœ… **Dynamic Modal Consistency**: Real SDK integration at app level
âœ… **Phantom Connection Stalling**: Enhanced error handling with 30-second timeout
âœ… **Provider Detection**: Proper multi-wallet support through Dynamic.xyz
âœ… **Connection Flow**: Professional UX with loading states and error recovery

## Expected Results:

- **Dynamic modal appears consistently** every time you click "Connect Wallet"
- **Phantom connects properly** without infinite loading
- **All supported wallets** (Phantom, MetaMask, Coinbase, Solflare, Backpack, etc.) show up
- **Professional UI** with proper loading states and error handling
